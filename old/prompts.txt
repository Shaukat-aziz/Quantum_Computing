solve the part b for time-dependent schrodinger equation for a guassian wave packet inside the same stadium as done for part A. and add this prompt to the prompts.txt

Check and verify if wave function renormalization is preserved in Part B (e.g., by modifying code to compute norms before renormalization and plotting conservation over time).

Evolve psi such that norm is preserved

for the part b question can you set the boundary condition of the stadium to be infinite rather than masking the probabilty. This will help in having the normalization condition preserved

only the walls of th stadium is infinite potential. set the potential outside the wall as zero and the thickness of a wall as parameter. plot difference between intial - final probability density inside the boundary vs the width of the wall of the stadium taken. vary width from 0 to some finite value
